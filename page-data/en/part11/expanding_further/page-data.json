What more could one possibly want? In the real world, there are more fingers in the pie than just developers and users. Even if that weren't true, even for developers, there's a lot more value to be gained from CI systems than just the above things.</p>\n<h3>Visibility and Understanding</h3>\n<p>In all but the smallest companies, decisions on what to develop are not made exclusively by developers. The term 'stakeholder' is often used to refer to people, both inside and outside the development team, who may have some interest in keeping an eye on the progress of development. To this end, there are often integrations between git and whatever project management/bug tracking software the team is using.</p>\n<p>A common use of this is to have some reference to the tracking system in git pull requests or commits. This way, for example, when you're working on issue number 123, you might name your pull request <code>BUG-123: Fix user copy issue</code> and the bug tracking system would notice the first part of the PR name and automatically move the issue to <code>Done</code> when the PR is merged.</p>\n<h3>Notifications</h3>\n<p>When the CI process finishes quickly, it can be convenient to just watch it execute and wait for the result. As projects become more complex, so too does the process of building and testing the code. This can quickly lead to a situation where it takes long enough to generate the build result that a developer may want to begin working on another task. This in turn leads to forgotten build. </p>\n<p>This is especially problematic if we're talking about merging PRs that may affect another developer's work, either causing problems or delays for them. This can also lead to a situation where you think you've deployed something but haven't actually finished a deployment, this can lead to mis-communication with team mates and customers (e.g. \"Go ahead and try that again, the bug should be fixed\").</p>\n<p>There are several solutions to this problem ranging from simple notifications to more complicated processes that simply merge passing code if certain conditions are met. We're going to discuss notifications as a simple solution since it's the one that interferes with the team workflow the least.</p>\n<p>By default, GitHub Actions sends an email on a build failure. This can be changed to send notifications regardless of build status and can also be configured to alert you on the GitHub web interface. Great. But what if we want more. What if for whatever reason this doesn't work for our use case.</p>\n<p>There are integrations, for example to various messaging applications such as [Slack<a href=\"https://slack.com/intl/en-fi/\"></a>, to send notifications. These integrations still decide what to send and when to send it based on logic from GitHub.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tasks\">\n<h3>Exercise 11.19</h3>\n<p>We have set up a Slack channel &#x3C;fullstackopengroup.slack.com> for testing amessaging integration. Join the channel by clicking <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/fullstackopengroup/shared_invite/zt-jy0669dd-41WHtYNO6WwBujp4djgJTA\">here</a>. Unfortunately you need an email address for registration. If are not willing to use your own address, you can very well use a temporal email for the purposes. There are lots of options such as <a href=\"https://tempmail.ninja/\">https://tempmail.ninja/</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that you need the Slack webhook URL for doing this exercise. If you do not have it yet, ask it by email matti.luukkainen@helsinki.fi of in course telegram, ping @mluukkai</p>\n<p>You can also use some other Slack channel in this exercise but then you are on your own with the setup.</p>\n<h4>11.19 Build success/failure notification action</h4>\n<p>You can find dozens of third party actions from [GitHub Action Marketplace]<a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions\">https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions</a>) by using a searcj the word <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions&#x26;query=slack\">slack</a>. Pick one for this exercise. My choice was <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/action-slack\">action-slack</a> since it has quite many starts and a decent documentation.</p>\n<p>Setup the action so that it gives two types of notifications.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A success indication if a new version gets deployed</li>\n<li>An error indication if abuild fails</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the case of an error, the notification should be a bit more verbose to help developers finding quickly what was the error and what is the commit that caused it.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#job-status-check-functions\">here</a> how to check the job status!</p>\n<p>Your notifications may look like the following:</p>\n<picture><img src=\"/static/5b9f688dc1c1b32bc0eda5002962ed4c/5a190/20a.png\" alt=\"Releases\" srcset=\"/static/5b9f688dc1c1b32bc0eda5002962ed4c/772e8/20a.png 200w,\n/static/5b9f688dc1c1b32bc0eda5002962ed4c/e17e5/20a.png 400w,\n/static/5b9f688dc1c1b32bc0eda5002962ed4c/5a190/20a.png 800w,\n/static/5b9f688dc1c1b32bc0eda5002962ed4c/c1b63/20a.png 1200w,\n/static/5b9f688dc1c1b32bc0eda5002962ed4c/29007/20a.png 1600w,\n/static/5b9f688dc1c1b32bc0eda5002962ed4c/668c6/20a.png 1692w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></picture>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<h3>Metrics</h3>\n<p>In the previous section we mentioned that as projects get more complicated, so too, do their builds and the duration that the builds take increases. That's obviously not ideal: The longer the feedback loop, the slower the development.</p>\n<p>While there are things that can be done about this increase in build times, it's useful to have a better view of the picture. It's useful to know how long a build took a few months ago versus how long it takes now. Was the progression linear or did it suddenly jump? Knowing what caused the increase in build time can be very useful in helping to solve it. If the build time increased linearly from 5 minutes to 10 over the last year, maybe we can expect it to take another few months to get to 15 minutes and we have an idea of how much value there is in spending time speeding up the CI process.</p>\n<p>Metrics can either be self-reported (also called 'push' metrics, where each build reports how long it took) or the data can be fetched from the API afterwards (sometimes called 'pull' metrics). The risk with self reporting is that the self reporting itself takes time and may have a significant impact on \"total time taken for all builds\".</p>\n<p>This data can be sent to a time series database or to an archive of another type. There are plenty of cloud services where you can easily aggregate the metrics, one good option is <a href=\"https://www.datadoghq.com/\">Datadog</a>.</p>\n<h3>Periodic tasks</h3>\n<p>There are often periodic tasks that need to be done in a software development team. Some of these can be automated with commonly available tools and some you will need to automate yourself.</p>\n<p>The former category includes things like checking packages for security vulnerabilities. There are several tools that can already do this for you. Some of these tools would even be free for certain types (e.g. open source) projects. Github provides one such tool, <a href=\"https://dependabot.com/\">Dependabot</a>.</p>\n<p>Words of advice to consider: If your budget allows it, it's almost always better to use a tool that already does the job than to roll your own solution. If security isn't the industry you're aiming for, for example, use Dependabot to check for security vulnerabilities instead of making your own tool.</p>\n<p>What about the tasks that don't have a tool? You can automate these yourself with GitHub Actions too. GitHub Actions provides a scheduled trigger that can be used to execute a task at a particular time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tasks\">\n<h3>Exercises 11.20-22</h3>\n<h4>11.20 Periodic health check</h4>\n<p>We are pretty confident now that our pipeline prevents bad code of being deployed. However there are many sources of errors. If our application would eg. depend on a database that would for some reason become unavailable, our application would most likely crash. That's why it would be good idea to set up <i>a periodic health check</i> that would regurarly do a HTTP GET request to our server. We quite often refer this kind of request as a <i>ping</i>.</p>\n<p>It is possible to <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events\">schedule</a> GitHub actions to happend regurarly. </p>\n<p>Use now action <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/url-health-check\">url-health-check</a> or any other alternatively and schedule a periodic health check ping to your deployed software. Try to simulate a situation where your application breaks down and ensure that the check detects the problem. Write this rule to an own file.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong> that unfortunately it takes quite long until GitHub Actions starts to schedule actions. For me it took nearly one hour. So it might be a good idea to get the the check working firstly by triggering the workflow with git push and when the check is properly working, then switch to a scheduled trigger.</p>\n<p><strong>Note also</strong> that once you are get this working, it is best to drop the ping frequency (to max once in 24 hours) or disable the rule altogether since otherways your health check may consume <a href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours\">all your</a> monthly free hours.</p>\n<h4>11.21 Your own pipeline</h4>\n<p>Build a simillar CI/CD-pipeline for some of your own products. A good candidate is the phonebook app that was built in parts 2 to 4 of the course, or bloglist built in part 5, or the redux anecdotes built in part 6. You may also use some app of your own here.</p>\n<p>You most likely need to do some restructuring to get all the pieces togeteher. A logical first step would be to store both the frontend and backend code in a same repository. This is not a requirement but it is recommended since it makes things much more simple.</p>\n<p>One possible repository structure would be to have backend at the root of repository and the fronend as a subdirectory. You can also \"copy paste\" the structure of the example app of this chapter or try out the <a href=\"https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/create-app\">example app</a> mentioned in <a href=\"/en/part7/class_components_miscellaneous#frontend-and-backend-in-the-same-repository\">part 7</a>.</p>\n<p>It is perhaps best to create a new repository for this exercise and simply copy and paste the old code. In real life you most likely would to this all in the old repository but now \"a fresh start\" makes things easier.</p>\n<p>This is a long and perhaps quite a tought exercise, but this kind of situation where you have a \"legacy code\" and you need to build it a proper deployment pipeline is quite commoin in real life!</p>\n<p>Obviously this exercise is not done in same repository as the previous exercises. Since you can return only one repository to submission systen, put a link of the <i>other</i> repository to the one you fill in to the submission form.</p>\n<h4>11.22 Protect master and ask for pull request</h4>\n<p>Protect the master branch of the repository where you did the previous exercise. This time prevent also administrator of merging the code without a review.</p>\n<p>Do a pull request and ask any of GitHub users <a href=\"https://github.com/mluukkai\">mluukkai</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kaltsoon\">kaltsoon</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/jakousa\">jakousa</a> to review your code. Once the review is done, merge your code to master. </p>\n<p>The you are done!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<h3>Submitting exercises and getting the credits</h3>\n<p>Exercises are submitted via <a href=\"https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/courses/fs-cicd-2020\">the submissions system</a> just like in the previous parts, but unike parts 0 to 9, the submission goes to different \"course instance\". </p>\n<p>Once you have completed the exercises and want to get the credits, let us know through the exercise submission system that you have completed the course:</p>\n<p>TODO pic</p>\n<p>Note that the \"exam done in Moodle\" note refers to the <a href=\"/en/part0/general_info#sign-up-for-the-exam\">Full Stack Open course's exam</a>, which has to be completed before you can earn credits from this part.</p>\n<p>You can download the certificate for completing this part by clicking one of the flag icons. The flag icon corresponds to the certificate's language. Note that you must have completed at least one credit worth of exercises before you can download the certificate.</p>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"mainImage":{"publicURL":"/static/83f1c8a7795e9e8eaffaec29b1ee79b1/part-1.svg"},"part":11,"letter":"e","lang":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"part":11,"letter":"e","lang":"en"}}}
